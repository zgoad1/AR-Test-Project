# Image Recognition & Tracking

Using the AR Tracked Image Manager to find images from a set library, and adding corresponding labels that follow the images.

Without anchors, planes and tracked images will snap back to their original positions after being confused, but objects not managed by Manager components may permanently change places.

When the same objects have AR Anchor components, they consistently snap back into place after being confused.
